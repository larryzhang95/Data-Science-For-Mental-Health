Open Source Repository for code and programs I am developing for research in the Mental Health/Computational Neuroscience Domain.

Pipeline and Feature Extractions used for Mental Health/Computational Neuroscience Research

Key Contributions:
- model.py: contains all function(s) for acquiring/extracting data, flattening data, and applying data to model(s)
- feature_embeddings.py: contains all function(s) for extracting audio feature(s)

Google AudioSet: VGGish Model for Audio Feature Embeddings (see Vggish<insert name>.Py Files)<br />
NeuroLex Diagnostics: Original Demo Day Project, continuing research following Demo Day<br />
Dr. Reza Ghomi with UW DigiPsych Laboratory: For allowing me to pursue research within the domain of Computational Neuroscience<br />

Current Work in Progress:

- Extracting MRMR Feature Embeddings
- Extracting geMaps Feature Embeddings
- Creating example demo for Bipolar Disorder. Will Be used for NeuroLex Demo

Future Work:
- Add in NLP Model(s) in parallel to to Voice/Audio Model(s)
- Generalize Data Acquisition to include MRMR and geMaps features once completed.
